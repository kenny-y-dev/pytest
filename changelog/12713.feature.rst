Add `--force-short-summary` option to force condensed summary output regardless of verbosity level

Adds ability to still see condensed summary output of failures for quick reference in log files from job outputs. Especially useful if non-condensed output is very verbose.

Also includes full fix for :issue:`11777` where sequences were still being shortened even with `-vv` verbosity.
